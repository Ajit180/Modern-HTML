Question 1: List out Features of HTML5.

Solution: 
 
      HTML5, the fifth version of the Hypertext Markup Language, introduces several new features and enhancements over its predecessors. 
   Here are some key features of HTML5:

1. Semantic Elements:
   - Introduces new semantic elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<figure>`, `<figcaption>`, etc.,
       which provide a more meaningful structure to web documents.

2. Audio and Video Support:
   - Native support for embedding audio and video content using `<audio>` and `<video>` elements, reducing the need for third-party plugins like Flash.

3. Canvas API:
   - Introduces the `<canvas>` element and associated JavaScript API, allowing for dynamic rendering of graphics, charts, and other visual elements.

4. Local Storage:
   - Provides a client-side storage mechanism through the `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` APIs, allowing web applications to store data locally on the user's device.

5. Offline Web Applications:
   - Offers the ability to create offline web applications using the Application Cache (AppCache)        feature, enabling users to access
content even without an internet connection.

6. WebSockets:
   - Supports the WebSocket protocol, allowing for real-time communication between a web browser and a web server over a single, long-lived connection.

7. Web Workers:
   - Introduces the concept of web workers, which enables the execution of JavaScript code in the background, improving 
the responsiveness and performance of web applications.

8. Geolocation API:
   - Provides a Geolocation API that allows web applications to access the user's geographical location, facilitating location-aware services.

9. Form Controls and Input Types:
   - Enhances form controls with new input types like `email`, `url`, `number`, `date`, `range`, and others, as well as attributes like `placeholder` and `pattern`.

10. Drag and Drop:
    - Supports native drag-and-drop functionality, allowing users to drag elements and drop them onto designated areas within a web page.

11. Responsive Design:
    - Promotes responsive web design by introducing features like the `<picture>` element for handling responsive images and the `<meta>` tag for viewport control.

12. New Document Structure:
    - Simplifies document structure with the removal of certain presentational elements (e.g., `<font>`, `<center>`) 
     and attributes in favor of more semantic alternatives.

13. SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics):
    - Provides native support for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), allowing the inclusion of vector-based images directly in the HTML document.

14. Accessibility Improvements:
    - Includes enhancements to improve web accessibility, such as the `alt` attribute for all images, native support
     for ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles, and other features.

15. CSS3 Integration:
    - Works seamlessly with CSS3 features, providing enhanced styling options and layout capabilities.
